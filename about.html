Located at Jawahar Nagar in Trivandrum, Grandeur offers state-of-the-art, premium makeup and grooming services for all occasions.</p>
                <p class="about-animation">Grandeur's inception as a brand dates back to 2015 when our Founder & Chief MUA Dr Shruthi Vijayan began working as a freelance makeup artist purely out of a passion towards fashion, styling and makeup. In three years time, our clientele grew to 50+ happy brides, with Grandeur and Dr Shruthi earning a lot of attention in the beauty industry in Kerala.</p>
                <p class="about-animation">The wholehearted support and motivation from our clients and well-wishers eventually helped us realise our biggest dream of our first brick-and-mortar store in December 2019, with premium wedding makeover and styling services. Having been in the beauty and wellness industry for a long time, we ensure world-class makeover services for our clients with absolute precision, offering you a stress-free experience on your big day.</p>
